## Run the game

As this is a work in progress, the basic implementation is not yet completed so you won't be able to play the game. If you still want to run the program:

### on Linux
Just launch the `Game` file in the `Build` folder to launch the compiled version.

### on Windows
The game should work if you recompile it on a Windows platform 🤞


### on Mac
Sorry, here you're on your own currently
