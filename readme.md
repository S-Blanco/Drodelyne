# Drodelyne

Drodelyne is a two player deck-driven strategy game.
Conquer more territory than your opponent to win.
Draw a card to see which move is at your disposal.

## Run the game

As this is a work in progress, the basic implementation is not yet completed so you won't be able to play the game. If you still want to run the program:

### on Linux
- Download the project
- Create a `Build`folder
- Open a terminal in the `Build` folder and execute the command `cmake ../src/`
- Once the previous command is executed, use the command `make`
- Now, launch the game either by clicking the `Game` icon or by typing in the terminal `./Game` 

### on Windows
The game should work if you recompile it on a Windows platform ðŸ¤ž


### on Mac
Sorry, here you're on your own currently but my guess is that it works the same as above.
